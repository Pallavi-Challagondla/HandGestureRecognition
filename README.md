# Hand Gesture Recognition

A **real-time hand gesture recognition system** built using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and **Machine Learning**.  
This project detects and classifies hand gestures like `open_palm`, `index_up`, `thumbs_up`, and `peace` using a webcam feed.

## Features

-  Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe**
-  Gesture classification with a trained **ML model (`gesture_model.pkl`)**
-  Supports multiple gesture types
-  Easily extendable for gesture-based control (e.g., media playback, mouse movement, volume control)
